3rd repository about project 2
second opportunity had problems migrating the site, because Go Daddy told me that I need to upgrade my SSL certificate.
Added last details, like the mobile responsive menu. After adding the plugin I coundnt see my regular menu bar. but when I see my site on my phone, it was necessary that step! Thank you!
